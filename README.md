# 🛡️ My CyberSecurity Projects

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to learning, building, and sharing practical **cybersecurity projects**. This space is a collection of all the tools, scripts, and utilities I create as I grow my skills in ethical hacking, penetration testing, digital forensics, and cybersecurity in general.

## 🎯 Why I Created This Repo

I believe the best way to **learn cybersecurity is by doing**. Instead of just watching tutorials or reading theory, I decided to build tools that solve real problems — like scanning ports, identifying hashes, or analyzing network data.

This repository is not just a portfolio — it's a proof of consistent learning, creativity, and curiosity. Every tool in here has taught me something new and helped me grow as a cybersecurity enthusiast.
